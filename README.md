DESCRIPTION
====================================================================================================================================================================================================
This project is to classify wine quality based on several factors included in the wine quality dataset. 
The dataset was obtained from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Before the model was trained, the data underwent several steps, such as data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis. 
These processes include data visualization, data cleaning, feature engineering, splitting data, data oversampling, and so on.
 
The model that was used as the final classifier is XGBoost, which was chosen because it performed better compared to several other machine learning models. 
After the comparison, the XGBoost model's performance was further improved by using hyperparameter tuning. As this project was made for college project purposes, no further deployment was done.
